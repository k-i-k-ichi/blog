Long before Iâ€™ve realized, I have took up reading, even though I used to be against it. I have thought about writting as I progress, but was never sure what to write about.

## Why ?

Getting off the mount stupid, by becoming open to criticism.

## The agony of living in the fast lane

I was always too eager for immediate results. It may push you (sometimes) for insane ammount of commitment. But in between the hype mountains lies deep valley of depression. I feel like writing should stretch things out, going slower means keeping fun in the house.

## What will it be ?

Occasionally posts will be on CS, programming, maybe maths, sharing interesting articles, also maybe music. What it will not be is a life style blog, since I'm a terrible advisor, even worse: my life is a mess. But on this first blog, this will ever be the only exception.
