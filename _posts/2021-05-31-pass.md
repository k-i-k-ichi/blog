# Password ?

It finally happened, some folks in my company leaked their mail password somewhere on the internet. Their account got logged in from a new device which prompted the SecOps guy to do a full password reset of everyone in that department. 2FA is now mandatory ( it was previously, but no one actually check if everyone has it enabled ) and require everyone to use a strong 12-characters password.

My password(s) has definitely been leaked on the internet. I've changed like 8 password over the course of 6 year, all of them being very similar to each other thou. So now I'm at a point where: A. I can't really generate more memorable password that is not "change-few-letters-from-old-passwords-until-the-site-accept-it", and B. my muscle memory is not large enough to hold 4 of 20-characters long password. "Maybe it's time to use an actual password managers" I thought so.

I've always been taken back by the idea of using password managers, mostly from the stuffs where they sync your password to "the cloud". How the hell can I be sure that my passwords are stored correctly ? What happens if the server goes down ? What the hell is running in their code ?

The code being open source is not enough of clarity for me,


# Pass

I just had everything pretty much mapped out in my mind while searching for Pass. The most simplistic password managers would just encrypt passwords and metadata inside a file. You can pipe your password directly to system's clipboard, no need for fancy browser extensions that would actually expose you to more vulnerability ( as a general rule complexity creates insecurity ). Pass just check every tickbox for me while being a very simple implementation.

Password Database ? It's just straight up directories. Encryption ? Trusty GnuPG. Syncing ? Pass uses Git, and I didn't even know I needed that, that also means you can host your own cloud storage with a simple Git's Remote setup.

# Introducing GPG a.k.a GNU PrivacyGuard

The backbone of Pass's cryptography. Pass relies on GPG ( GnuPG ) for encryption, so I will explain a bit about how you can generate an encryption key. And most importantly, how to manage your keyrings ( a collection of crypto keys ).

## 1.1 Generating Key(s)

When running GPG with the `--expert` option, you are greeted with a list of options to choose your prefered cryptosystem. [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)), [DSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm), and [ECC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography) all refers to 3 popular Public-Keys cryptosystem.


```
>gpg --expert --full-gen-key                                                                                                                                                             0

Now, GPG recommends you to generate 2 set of key pairs, the **Signing Key** and the **Encryption Key** ( or **Encryption Sub-key** ).

### Why 2 set of keys ?

When doing cryptography on the internet, there are 2 things you will be doing:

- Signing over some messages so people know that this is from you, and you only.
- Encrypting some messages so no one but you & recipent can read the messages.

The signature bit is generally considered to be much more important than the encryption bit, because it goes hand-in-hand with your **identity** on the internet. If someone have access to your private key, they can pose as you on the internet, they can sign any kind of document and others will believe that it's you who has signed it. Announcing to other people that your signature has been hjacked is a very painful process, and you will have to build your reputation again from the ground up when switching to a new signing key ( that is if you don't want to expose your real-world ID documents ).

You will want to keep your signing key very secure, you don't want to store this key on a machine, but on a hardware / key device safe in somewhere safe. The less you use this key, the less likely that it is going to be cracked. But this come at a cost of usability: it's very much of a hassle to use.
                                                                                                                                                        l
So the solution is you can use a separate key for other tasks for more convenience. You can generate a secondary **sub-key** for stuffs that you just want to get it done quick. If it happens that a hacker got hold of your key, you can invalidate and replace it quite quickly with a new key. Your sub-key is just as secure as your primary key, they are in fact look just like any other crypto keys. The only difference is just how you manage them in daily operation.

The second point on this is that using the same key for both **signing** and **encryption** is very very insecure. For public key cryptosystems, signing  and decrypting a message are essentially **identical operation**. So if someone took a an message encrypted using your public key, and ask you to sign it with the private key, you are giving them the decrypted message. Obviously this is very bad so it's always recommended to generate a new key for encryption, separated from your signing key.

You can actually sign the encryption key with your signing key, to prove that this encrypted message is sent from you.

To Recap:

| Signing Key                                       | Encryption Key                     |
| ---                                               | ---                                |
| Used for authentication                           | Used for secrecy                   |
| Hard to change, stick with your online reputation | Very easy to change if ever leaked |
